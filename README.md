# CameraShake
This is a Camera Shake effect script written by me in C#.
This script uses perlin noise to get a random value. If you're planning to use this script in your mobile game; that already 
requires heavy computing power, then I would recommend you not to use this script.

//Feel free to use this script in your commercial projects
